=======================================
QURP:
=======================================
	A barebones port of quake one for the Raspberry Pi

This port is from the original source found here : https://github.com/id-Software/Quake 
All the original lgal stuff can be found in the original readme files.

=======================================
Building
=======================================
	-You will to place a copy of the original games under Winquake/id1

	In make.rpi chaneg the following lines to the appropriate directory:
		MOUNT_DIR=/home/${USER}/programming/qurp/WinQuake
		MASTER_DIR=/home/${USER}/programming/qurp/WinQuake

	In my case I have qurp installed in /home/pi/programming/qurp

	Navigate to [installed directory]/Winquake and run either
		./Build.sh build_debug 
		./Build.sh build_release


=======================================
Issues
=======================================
-The release version crashes on starting the game from the main menu, it will run the demos though
-no mouse support & poor keyboard support
	might i sbe better to use SDL? can it be included as an internal library?
-Performance Issues
	The graphics commands probably need a big overhaul, currently the wrapper created one big VBO 
	which is filled until a state change is made that would require a flush of the previously buffered commands
	It's almost definitely better to create VBOs for individual data where possible and upload the vertices only once.
-Lots of others
